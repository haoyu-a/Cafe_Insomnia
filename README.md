# Cafe_Insomnia
## Problem Background
A group of coffee-loving University of Sydney alumni have successfully set up a cafe, called 'Caf√© Insomnia' on University of Sydney campus that only opens at night.

Unfortunately it has been hard to predict demand and the cafe is often over or understaffed. The cafe owners hired a consultant to do an exploratory analysis to determine if a model could be built to predict demand.

The consultant reported that such a model could not be built. However the owners felt that the consultant did not do a sufficiently detailed job and have sought you to provide a second opinion.

The store is located next to the Fisher Library. The trading hours of the store is between 7pm and 1am for 7 days a week.

Individual transaction records of the store are collected from 2019 July 22 to 2019 December 22. In addition to collecting purchase related information, each customer was asked to select where on campus she/he was studying and whether it was raining (via an iPad at the cashier's counter).
